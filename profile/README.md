## About Us

 We are a group of young students from Poland. We are creating a new project during our internship which will attract students, engineers and technology enthusiasts. We are sharing our code-work with you as an open source file.

## About the Project

Our goal is to replace a regular key by a system which will open a lock by reading a QR code out of our smartphone. System is based on raspberry, literally pulled out of the company trash. We would like to create it on a budget so every of you could recreate it on garage.  

Every member of our small team have a certain task to do such as programming the lock, creating mobile app and building whole system to add keys proper locks.
